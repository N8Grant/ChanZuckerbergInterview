"""
Segment the cells‚Äô nuclei from your channel of choice and store the
segmentations into an OME-Zarr store using iohub as Zarr Arrays.
- Computes at least 5 metrics or algorithms to characterize and detect the infection
dynamics. (e.g. intensity, segmentation, etc). Can you find the infected cells?
- Generates visualizations of image data and the image analysis results (i.e, matplotlib,
napari, etc).
- Save the visualizations (e.g as .png, .mp4,.jpg, etc). You will share this
output with us


This script will showcase the use of the segmentation api and the toolkit that I built to
examine the given cell datasets.
